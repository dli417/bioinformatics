# Task

Use RMarkdown to summarise the most important bits of what you have learned so far - i.e. make a sort of cheat sheet for yourself of useful functions or insights. This will be different for everyone, so I won’t tell you what to put on it but I do suggest you include a table of useful functions which you have come across during your reading.

# Useful functions

# Week one insights

## Good coding practice

- Write complex code in .R document, not console
- Console is used for experimenting with code
- Comment code using `#` for legibility

## Non-trivial answers

```{r}
# Dividing by zero
1 / 0
-1 / 0

# Divide zero by zero
0 / 0
```

## Writing your own functions

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# function layout below
function_name <- function(arg1, arg2, …) {
    var1 <- function_logic_here
    return(var1)
}

```

# Week two insights

## GitHub

- GitHub is an online repository for sharing/collaborating on code. Frontend for Git
- Git is a version control system

### GitHub concepts

Project code stored in repositories. Repositories are usually stored remotely/online (i.e. hosted on GitHub), however code is usually **cloned** to local environment and worked on locally/offline. Once significant progress has been achieved, a **commit** is created with a description of the changes, followed by a **push** to upload the changes to the online repository. If a local cloned repository is behind on commits present on a remote repository, the changes can be **pulled** from the remote repository.

All code in the repository exists on branches. The default branch is known as `main` (and previously `master`). New branches can be created to experiment with changes to the repository, without affecting code on main. As the main branch should always be functioning code, new features and fixes should be worked on in a branch and **merged** with main only when it is ready. Branch names should be descriptive of what is being worked on.

To work on the repository of another GitHub user, their repository can be **forked**. This places a copy of their repository under your GitHub user.

The version control aspect of Git means every change to the repository is recorded and can be reverted or reverted to.

- To reset local environment to previous commit

  `$ git reset --hard commit_SHA_here`

  `--hard` flag is passed to undo current changes (so repository files are restored to previous commit)

### GitHub repository files

- README.md - Provides information on the project. Document parsed as [GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)](https://github.github.com/gfm/)
- .gitignore - Files and folders to exclude from upload to repository
- .git folder - Folder containing information used by Git

## R Markdown

- Markdown document with inline executable R code chunks
- Provide document information in header of R Markdown file

- ```

### Code chunks

Code chunks begin with ` ```{r, args} ` and end with ` ``` `:

![R Markdown code chunk (RStudio)](code-chunk-rstudio.png)

![R Markdown code chunk (VS Code)](code-chunk-vs-code.png)

Args for ` ```{r, args} `:

Arg               | Description
:-----------------|:--------------------
echo = TRUE/FALSE | Show/hide code chunk
eval = TRUE/FALSE | Run/don't run code
fig.cap="x"       | Figure caption for plots

Load packages in r setup script:

```{r setup, eval=FALSE}
# Load tidyverse
library(tidyverse)
```

Write database to file:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
setwd(dirname(rstudioapi::getActiveDocumentContext()$path))
vroom_write(to_sort_pop_total_long, "../week 3/to_sort_pop_total_long_left.csv")
```

# Week three insights

## Week three data types

- Matrices - 2 dimensions containing a single type of data
- Arrays are n dimensional matrices containing a single type of data
- data.frames (including tibble) can contain multiple data types
- Lists - structures containing nested information of multiple types

# Week four insights

left_join(): (return all rows from x, and all columns from x and y)
